          <h2 id="terminal">"You have been Terminated"</h2>
            <p>On my first week of Wyncode I learned how to use the terminal!</p>
            <p>To be satirically honest, at first I thought you could do cool things like this:
              <p>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rlfwXNOG0eI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
              </p>
              <p>Sadly that's not how the real terminal works. However it's still very powerful tool as a programmer.</p>
              <p>You can still do many cool and powerful tricks without even using the graphical user interface.</p>

          <p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4DajnIUcAAQ1mk.jpg" alt="My Terminal window when it's not clicked on" width="700"/> <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4Dak5hVUAAwZQT.png" alt="When I click on it the transparency decreases and I can start typing!" width="700"/></p>
          <p><i>"You can even customize it! It's the very first thing I did. So instead of the boring white/black default console,</p>
          <p>I did a cool transparent purple and <em>I LOVE IT ALOT!"</em></i></p>

          <h2 id="making_directories">"Making Directories"</h2>
            <p>The first thing I've learned is that the terminal is simply a text only form of my GUI</p>
            <p>Simple normal things like making folders, files, documents, everything I can do on my computer,</p>
            <p>I can also do on my terminal, and it's a little confusing at first but it's really cool once I got the hang of it.</p>
            <p>I can look at where I am inside my computers, create directories, concatenate my files and read what it says,</p>
            <p>and create sub folders inside my directories and move them around, or <em>carefully</em> delete them</p>
            <p>It's very useful and fun!</p>

            <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fIVBPhR.png" alt="Here's my screenshot!"/>
          </p>
            <p><i>This is a screenshot of me navagating in my terminal and creating a new directory called "Screenshot!"</i></p>

            <h2 id="dogs">"Man and Cats but Sadly no Dogs"</h2>
              <p>I think one of the coolest part of the terminal is when ever I get confused I can always use the Manual command,</p>
              <p> or <em>"man"</em> and read up the discription on what any command that I may not know of yet or understand.</p>
              <p> i can look the man up for pwd, mkdir, cd, ls, cat, mv, rm, <em>EVEN</em> man itself! </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Po2Kld4.png"/>
              </p>
              <p><em> "Screenshot of the input command "man man" it's pretty manly I guess."</em></p>

              <p>So that's pretty much for Command Line, I know there is alot more deeper things that goes into it and I can't wait to learn</p>
              <p>more in depth on how to use it!</p>
