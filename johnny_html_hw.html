            <p>Hi! I just started Wyncode this week and I learned <i>ALOT</i>. </p>
            <p>This is pretty exciting, and I'm really looking forward to learn</p>
            <p>alot about coding! I'm even doing HTML pretty well now as you can</p>
            <p>see! So far this week I've learned 2 very important skills to start</p>
            <p>my role as a programmer: The Command Line and HTML! Here are the links</p>
            <p>below to read more about my experiences about both of these concepts!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="johnny_html_hw_link_1.html">Command Line!</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="johnny_html_hw_link_2.html">HTML</a>
            </li>
            <li> Crying, crying alot!</li>
        </ul>
